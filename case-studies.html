headline: reducing consumption, increasing savings
case-one: Manufacturing | Melbourne, VIC
case-one-text: |
    Gravitas installed a 30kW solar system for a manufacturing company in Melbourne. As a Contestable Customer with high energy consumption, the business was particularly interested in controlling their network demand charges.

    By installing a 30kW solar system, Variable Speed Drivers and LED lighting, the businesses’ energy consumption was dramatically reduced. The business has seen the results on their energy bill in the 6 months since installation and are currently investigating the opportunity to increase their solar system size to 60kW.
case-two: A Medical Centre in Melbourne, November 2015
case-two-text: |
    Gravitas installed a 20kW AC system for a Medical Centre in Melbourne. Their energy consumption on air conditioning dropped by 75% in the 6 months following installation and the project was completed with minimum interruption to normal operations.
case-three: A Manufacturing Company in Melbourne, late 2015
case-three-text: |
    Gravitas installed a 30kW solar system for another manufacturing company in Melbourne. The factory had reached the maximum limit of power available and could not take on any additional contracts. The installation of the solar system resulted in the business’ billable consumption dropping from 8,736kWhs to 4,329 kWhs, a 50% reduction. At the same time, the businesses’ energy requirements were met, allowing them to expand and grow.
